# Symbol Related Keyboard Shortcuts for VSCode

"Programmers, know thy tools!"

This is a commandment that many programmers live by.
It means to know the tools you use every day really well,
_especially keyboard shortcuts_.

I've noticed even some advanced programmers don't know the shortcuts
I'm about to present to you. And this is unfortunate, because
they are productivity boosters no matter what skill level you are at.

A **symbol** is a name for something like a variable or a function.
In Typescript, a symbol can also be a name for a type.

---

### F7

- if cursor is on a symbol, jump to next symbol, within same file

### Shift+F7

- if cursor is on a symbol, jump to previous symbol, within same file

---

### Ctrl+Shift+.

- shows only top level collapsed symbols, sorted by location, not alpha, within a file
- only allows you to type and search for symbols are currently viewable by being unexpanded.
- does allow you to navigate the breadcrumb hierarchy (Ctrl+Left and Ctrl+Right)

### Ctrl+Shift+o

- shows all symbols, uncollapsed, sorted by alpha not by location, within a file
- allows you to type and search for symbols that are deeply nested.

---

As an aside, if you prefer to open the Outline in the sidebar, you can map your own keyboard short cut.
The command is called Explorer: Focus on Outline View (outline.focus).
I like Ctrl+Alt+o

---

### F12

- Cursor must be on the symbol
- Jumps to the definition of the symbol

### Ctrl+t

- Your cursor does not need to be on a symbol to search for it
- Only searches for definitions
- Does not search for references or implementations
- Searches for symbols through all files in workspace
- üôÅ even searches through node_modules

---

### Ctrl+K F12

- Opens definition to the side
- Close again with Ctrl+w,
- focus on first editor with Ctrl+1
- back to second editor again with Ctrl+2

### Ctrl+Shift+F10

- Peek at the definition
- Esc to Close

---

### Shift+F12

- Peek at references
- F12 and Shift+F12 to navigate
- Arrows to open and close, expand and collapse, and Enter to select
- Esc Closes

### Shift+Alt+F12

- üòé Find All References (in side bar)
- Arrow keys to navigate
- Enter to select
- Ctrl+0 to focus on sidebar
- Ctrl+1 to focus on first editor

---

### Ctrl+F12

- Go to implementations
- If only one implementation, it will jump to it (similar to F12, but focuses on the symbol, not the definition)
- Otherwise, behaves like Ctrl+Shift+F12

### Ctrl+Shift+F12

- Peeks at implementations
- F12 and Shift+F12 to navigate
- Arrows to open and close, expand and collapse, and Enter to select
- Esc Closes

---

If you are playing around with F12 keyboard shortcuts, you might accidentally run into this:

### Ctrl+Alt+F12

- ‚ö†Ô∏è*Warning!* Has special meaning in Ubuntu.
- If you accidentally press this, rescue yourself with Ctrl+Alt+F2

---

Saving the best for last...

### F2

- most powerful refactoring tool ever
- renames a symbol across all files (without saving them)
- I strongly recommend a keyboard shortcut to run the command File: Save All. I personally use Ctrl+K a
